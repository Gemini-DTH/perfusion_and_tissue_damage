# perfusion_and_tissue_damage

This repository contains software corresponding to WP5 of the INSIST project (https://www.insist-h2020.eu/).

The folders have the following purpose:

1; brain_meshes: collection of patient specific labelled tetrahedral meshes sufficient for finite element simulations.

2; perfusion: multi-compartment Darcy flow solver describin blood flow in healthy and occluded scenarios.

3; oxygen: multi-compartment advection-reaction-diffusion problem describing oxygen transport in the brain.

4; tissue_health: metabolism model capturing tissue damage as a function of time before, during, and after stroke treatment.
